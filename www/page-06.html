    <h2>Pompeii - The Lost City</h2> 
      <p>
        Pompeii was a large Roman town in the Italian region of Campania which was completely buried in volcanic ash following the eruption of nearby Mt. Vesuvius in 79 CE.
        </p> 
      <p>
        The town was excavated in the 19th and 20th century CE and due to its excellent state of preservation it has given an invaluable insight into the Roman world and may lay claim to being the richest archaeological site in the world in terms of the sheer volume of data available to scholars.

    <h2>How to get there</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pompeii - is easily accessible by train from Naples or Sorrento.</li>
        <li>Mount Vesuvius - a private bus will take you to the entrance.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
   <h2>Mount Vesuvius</h2>  
     <p>
       Mount Vesuvius, on the west coast of Italy, is the only active volcano on mainland Europe. 
       It is best known because of the eruption in A.D. 79 that destroyed the cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, 
       but Vesuvius has erupted more than 50 times. 
     </p>
       <img src="./images/vesuvio.jpg" class="medium-centre-img">  
     <p>
       The volcano is classed as a complex stratovolcano because its eruptions typically involve explosive eruptions as well as pyroclastic flows. A pyroclastic flow is a high-density mix of hot lava blocks, pumice, ash and volcanic gas, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.
       </p>
   <h3>Climb Mount Vesuvius</h3> 
     <p>
       It is fairly easy to climb to the top of Mount Vesuvius and look into the crater!
       A bus will take you to the entry point at the car park. From there it is around a 20 minute uphill walk.
       It is definitely worth it to see inside the volcano and also to view the Bay of Naples from above.

      <h4>Pompeii Artefacts</h4>
        <img src="./images/artefacts.jpg" class="small-right-img">
        <p>
        The site of Pompeii is an archaeological time capsule, known for containing almost perfectly preserved frescoes, mosaics, graffiti and remains of food that unlock the everyday features of life in a Roman town.
        </p>

      <h4>Pompeii Streets</h4>
        <img src="./images/pompeii.jpg" class="small-right-img">
        <p>
          The Streets of Pompeii were paved during Roman times with large polygonal blocks of stone. They are bordered by curbs and pedestrian walkways.
          </p>
        <p> 
          On most streets there are raised stones at regular intervals that pedestrians used to cross the streets when water flooded them.
