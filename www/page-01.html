    <h2> Rome - The Eternal City </h2>
    <p>
      Rome is without doubt one the most beautiful cities in the world; every year millions of tourists come from around the world to admire the treasures and masterpieces of Roman art and architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea.

  <h2>Things to do in Rome</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Trevi Fountain - a late Baroque masterpiece and arguably the best known fountain.</li>
      <li>Via Appia Antica- one of the oldest and most important roads from Rome.</li>
      <li>Colloseum - an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome.</li>
      <li>Trastavere - one of the best areas for dining in Rome.</li>
      <li>Botanical Gardens - a pleasant respite from the tourist laden city, across the river.</li>
      </ul>

  <h3>The Trevi Fountain</h3>
    <p>
      The Trevi Fountain (Italian: Fontana di Trevi) is a fountain in the Trevi district in Rome, Italy, designed by Italian architect Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini and several others. 
      </p>
    <p>  
      Standing 26.3 metres (86 ft) high and 49.15 metres (161.3 ft) wide, it is the largest Baroque fountain in the city and one of the most famous fountains in the world.
      </p>
  <h3>The Appian Way</h3>
    <p>
      The Appian Way (Latin and Italian: Via Appia Antica) is one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of the ancient republic. It connected Rome to Brindisi, in southeast Italy.
      </p>
   <h3>The Colloseum</h3>
    <p>
      Built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete, it was the largest amphitheatre ever built at the time and held 50,000 to 80,000 spectators.
      </p>     
 <h3>Trastevere & the Botanical Gardens</h3>
   <p>
     A walk through the narrow cobbled streets of the Trastevere shows hidden treasures such as modest medieval churches, small shops with the most unusual objects, or even some scenes of everyday life seemingly taken from a forgotten age.
     </p>
   <p>
     Also located in the Trastevere area are the Botanical Gardens. I found this a welcome retreat from the madness of Rome. More than three thousand different plant species can be found here on a 12 hectare / 30 acre large sloping terrain.
