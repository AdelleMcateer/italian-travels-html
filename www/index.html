      Italy is the fifth most visited country in the world, with a total of 52.3 million international arrivals in 2016.

  <h2>When to go to Italy</h2>
    <p>
      Italy’s Mediterranean climate makes it a year-round destination with thrilling activities for every season. In general, the summers are hot and dry, and the winters are cold and damp. 
      </p>
    <p>
      The best months to visit Italy are April to June and September to October when the weather is comfortably warm.
      However, visiting in January or February can be rewarding if the weather is good as there are fewer tourists around.
      </p>
